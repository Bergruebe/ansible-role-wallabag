# THIS ROLE DOSE NOT WORK!
I don't get the docker container running. I'm not sure if it is a permission error, or due to the fact, that I bind /etc to /mash/wallabag/config/etc because the container needs to write config files there.

If somebody has an idea, I'm happy to accept a PR and to reopen this PR! ðŸ˜€
